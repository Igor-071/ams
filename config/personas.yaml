# Vibecoding Workflow - AI Team Personas
#
# This workflow uses 2 AI personas that collaborate on development:
# - Tech Lead: Handles specs, architecture, and implementation
# - Quality Lead: Handles testing, reviews, and quality assurance
#
# The AI switches between these personas based on the current phase.
